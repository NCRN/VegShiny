      <p>This map displays the results of an ongoing forest monitoring program conducted by the National Park Service in eleven parks in the Washington DC area. Each circle indicates the location of a permanent forest monitoring plot. Clicking on a circle will produce a popup with the name of the park the plot is located in, the name of the plot, the year that the data was collected and the value that is being mapped. </p>
      <h4>Map Controls</h4>
      <p><strong>Type of plant: </strong>
        This control allows you to toggle between the different types of plants (see the "Project Information" tab for details on plant types). Changing the plant type will automatically make appropriate changes to the values on the map legend, the data that can be mapped, and the species avialable for mapping.  
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data to map: </strong>
        Depending on the type of plant chosen, a variety of data can be mapped. These include:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Abundance: </strong>This is an esimtate of how many individuals of a given species are found in each forested hectare in the park. A hecatre is 2.47 acres, approximately the size of two football fields. This measure is available for trees, saplings, tree seedlings, shrubs, shrub seedlings, and vines on trees. </li>
          <li><strong>Basal Area: </strong> Basal area is the area of the cross section of a tree or sapling at 1.37 meters (4.5 feet) above the ground. It is an important measure of the size of a tree. This measure is available for trees and saplings.  </li>
          <li><strong>Percent cover: </strong> Percent cover is a measure of what percent of a plot is covered by the leaves and stems of a plant species. It can be used a measure of size or abundance. This is particularly useful for species which grow as numerous small individuals, such as blades of grass, which cannot be easily counted.  This measure is available for understory plants.  </li>  
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Years to display: </strong>
        Each forest monitoring plot is visited once very four years. You can choose which 4-year set to display by chosing the end year using the slider. For example, if you choose 2009, then the data for 2006-2009 will be displayed. If you choose 2011, they the map will display 2008-2011. Over time, a few monitoring plots have been removed from the study and others have been added. Choosing different time periods will therefore result in slightly different groups of plots being displayed. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Common Names: </strong>
        Use this check box to indicate if you want to use common names for plants (checked) or Latin names for plants (unchecked).
      </p>
      <p><strong>Choose a species: </strong>
        This allows you to select an individual species to display or choose "All species" for data on all species combined. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Filter by Park: </strong>
        This allows you to pick one of the parks to act as a filter. Once you pick a park, the "Choose a species" control will only show species that are found in the chosen park. 
      </p>

    <h4>Map Layers</h4>
      <p> This control allows you to add an additional data layer onto the map. Currently two options are avaialable:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Ecoregions: </strong> This selection will map the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions/na_eco.htm", target="_blank">Level III ecoregions (Omernik 1995)</a> onto the parks. Ecoregions are areas have similar ecosystems. </p>
      <p><strong>Forested Areas: </strong>This selection will highlight which areas of the parks are forested. This map is based on information from the <a href="http://www.mrlc.gov", target="_blank">2011 National Land Cover Database (Jin et al. 2013).</a> </p>
      <p><strong>Soil Map: </strong> This selection displays the soil orders of the soils found in the parks. ""Soil order"" is the broadest level of soil classification. The data on soil orders comes from the <a href="http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/soils/index.cfm" target="_blank"> National Park Service Soil Resouces Inventory </a></p>
    
    <br>
    <h4> Zoom </h4>
    <p><strong>Zoom to park: </strong>You can select a park from the dropdown menu and click on "Go" to zoom the map to that park.</p>
    <p><strong>Enlarge plots: </strong>By default, the monitoring plots are dispalyed to scale when the map is zoomed in. The enlarge plots control allow you to make then appear 5, 10, or 25 times larger, which is easier to see.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Show</h4>
    The show panel allows you to hide controls and legends to better view the map. Note that the "Layer Legend" panel will only appear if a map layer is selected.

<h3>Data by Park and Species</h3>
  <p>These graphs allow you to see estimates of the abundance, size, and percent of monitoring plots occupied by particular species in each park. The graphs show the mean (dot) and the 95% confidence intervals (bars) for the selected species. By choosing the "Data table" tab at the top of the page you can see a table which shows data for all the species in a park.</p>
<p>
  There are three options for choosing species to graph:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Most common species:</strong> This option will display the species with the largest mean abundance, basal area, etc. You can select the number of species to display.  </li>
  <li><strong>Pick individual species:</strong> This option allows you to pick which species to display. Click in the box to see a list of species and click on a species to choose it. To unselect a species, click on its name and then press the backspace key. You can choose as many species as you like. </li>
  <li><strong>All species combined:</strong> This option graphs the data for all of the species added together. This data can also be seen as the "Total" in the table under the "Data table" tab.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Depending upon the type of plant selected there are a variety of measurements that can be graphed:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Abundance: </strong>This is an esimtate of how many individuals of a given species are found in each forested hectare of a park. A hecatre is 2.47 acres, approximately the size of two football fields. This measure is available for trees, saplings, tree seedlings, shrubs, shrub seedlings, and vines on trees. It is expressed as #/ha. </li>
    <li><strong>Basal Area: </strong> Basal area is the area of the cross section of a tree or sapling at 1.37 meters (4.5 feet) above the ground. It is an important measure of the size of a tree. This measure is available for trees and saplings.  </li>
    <li><strong>Percent of Plots Occupied: </strong> This measure indicates the percentage of monitoring plots in a park that contain a particular species. This measure, along with the map, can indcate how widespread a species is. This measure is available for all types of plants.  </li>
  <li><strong>Percent Cover: </strong> Percent cover is a measure of what percent of a plot is covered by the leaves and stems of a plant species. It can be used as a measure of size or abundance. This is particularly useful for species which grow as numerous small individuals, such as blades of grass, which cannot be easily counted.  This measure is available for understory plants.  </li> </ul>
</p>
  <p>Once you have selected the primary data you wish to graph, you can add comparison data. Three options are available:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Park:</strong> This will allow you to compare a second park to the first. If you have selected to graph the "Most common species" then the most common species from the base park will be displayed. If you have selected to "Pick individual species" then you can only pick species present in the base park.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> This allows you to compare two different growth stages of the same species. You can make comparisons between trees, saplings, and tree seedlings, or between shrubs and shrub seedlings. This option is not available for understory plants or vines on trees, as only one growth stage of these species is monitored.</li>
    <li><strong>Time:</strong> This option allows you to make comparisons between different sets of years.  </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Statistical Details</h4>
<p> Mean values (averages) are always calculated by first summing the values for the montioring plots in a park and then dividing by the number of plots in the park.  The means and confidence intervals are first calcualted on a per plot basis and then converted to a per hecatare basis. The 95% confidence intervals are more complicated to calculate and depend on the type of data graphed.</p>
   <p><strong>Abundance</strong> The 95% confidence interval is calculated by fitting the number of plants found in each plot to a negative binomial distribution. Using  negative binomial estimation ensures that the 95% confidence interval will never include negative numbers of plants, and often results in confidence interavals that are not symmetric around the mean.</p>
  <p><strong>Basal Area</strong> Basal area measurements often do not fit any standard statistical distribution. To account for this, the 95% confidence interval is calculated by bootstrapping the observed data.</p>
  <p><strong>Percent of Plots Occupied</strong> 95% confidence intervals are calculated by fitting the data to a binomial distribution.</p>
  <p><strong>Percent Cover</strong> Like basal area, confidence intervals are calculated using bootstrapping.</p>

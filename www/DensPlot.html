<h3>Data by Park and Species</h3>
  <p>These graphs allow you to see esimates of the abundance, size and % of monitoring plots occupied by species in each park. The plots show the mean (dot) and the 95% confidence intervals (bars) for the selected species. By choosing the "Data"" tab at the top of the page you can see a table which shows data for all the species.</p>
<p>
  There are three options for choosing species to graph:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Most common species:</strong> This option will display the species with the largest mean value of abundance, basal area etc. The number of species to display can be selected as well.  </li>
  <li><strong>Pick individual species:</strong> This option allows you to pick which species to display. Click in the text box to see a list of species and click on a species to choose it. To unselect a species, click on its name and then press the backspace key. </li>
  <li><strong>All species combined:</strong>This options graphs the data for all of the species added together. This data can also be seen as the "Total" in the table on "Data" tab.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Depending upon the type of plant selected there are a variety of measurements that can be graphed:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Abundance:</strong>This measure is available for trees, saplings, tree seedlings, shrubs, shrub seedlings and vines on trees. The 95% confidence interval is calculated by fitting the number of plants found in each plot to a negative binomial distribution. The means and confidence intervals are convetred from a per plot basis to a per hecatare basis. Note that using negative binomial esitamation ensures that the 95% conficence interval will never include negative numbers of plants, and often results in confidence interavals that are not symmetric around the mean. </li>
    <li><strong>Basal Area:</strong> This measure is available for trees and saplings. Basal area is the area of the cross sectional of a tree or sapling at 1.37 meters above the ground. It is a measure of how large a tree is. The 95% confidence interval is calculated by bootstrapping the observed data.</li>
    <li><strong>Percent of Plots Occupied:</strong> This measure is available for all types of plants. This measure indicates the percentage of monitoring plots that contain a particular species. 95% confidence intervals are calculated by fitting the data to a binomial distribution. </li>
  <li><strong>Percent cover:</strong> This measure is available for understory plants. Percent cover is a measure of what percent of a plot is covered by vegetation of each species. Like basal area, confidence intervals are calculated using bootstrapping. </li>
  </ul>
</p>
  <p>Once you have selected the base data you wish to graph, you can also graph comparison data. Three options are available:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Park:</strong> This will allow you to chose a second park to compare the base park with. If you have selected to graph the "Most common species" then the most common species from the base park will be displayed. If you have selected to "Pick individual species" then you can only chose to pick species present in the base park.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong>You can make comparisons between trees, saplings and tree seedlings, or betwween shrubs and shrub seedlings. This option is not available for understory plants or vines on trees.</li>
    <li><strong>Time:</strong>This option allows you to make comparisons between different sets of years.  </li>
  </ul>

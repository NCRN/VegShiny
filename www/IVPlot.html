<h3> Forestry Importance Value</h3>
<p>  Forestry Importance values are an index which of the relative importance of tree species in a forested area. This index was develped by .... The index is made up of three components:
<ul>
  <li>Relative Abundance
    <p> Relative abundance (also known as relative density) measures the abundance of each species compared to the combined abundance of all species. For a given species "X", the relative abundance is: <br><br>
    <i> Relative abundance of X = (Abundance of X) / (Abundance of all Species)</i> <br><br>
      Abundance is typically measured as a the number of individual plants (trees, saplings etc.) found.

  <li>Relative Dominance</li>
  <li>Relative Distribution</li>

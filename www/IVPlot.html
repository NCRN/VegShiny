<h3> Forestry Importance Value</h3>
<p>  Forestry Importance values (IVs) are an index which of the relative importance of tree species in a forested area.
  This index was develped by Curtis and Macintosh (1951). The index is used to get an idea as to which tree species are the
  most important based on sampling monitoring plots in a forest.  No index will be able to capture every meaning of
  "importance" - for example a rare tree might be an important food source for a particular species of index. In practice,
  however, the IVs give a general indication of which species are the most dominant in the forest. 
</p>
<p>
  The index is made up of three components:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Relative Density:</strong>
    <p>Relative density (also known as relative abundance) measures the abundance of each species compared to the combined
    abundance of all species. For a given species "X", the relative density is: <br><br>
    <i> Relative density of X = (Density of X) / (Density of all Species)</i> <br><br>
        Density is typically measured as a the number of individual plants (trees, saplings etc.) found per plot. 
  </p></li>
  <li><strong>Relative Dominance (Size)</strong>
    <p> Relative dominance is a measure of the size of each species compared to the combined size of all species. For a
        given species "X", the relative dominance is: <br><br>
    <i> Relative  dominance of X = (Dominance of X) / (Dominance of all Species)</i> <br><br>
      Dominance of trees and saplings is measured as the basal area of the plant, which is the area of a cross section of
      the plant measured at 1.37m above the ground. For seedlings, we measure dominace as the height of the seedlings, as
      most of them are smaller than 1.37 m tall. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Relative Distribution</strong>
    <p> Relative distriburion is a measure of how often each species is found compared to how often all specis are found.
        For a given species "X", the relative distribution is: <br><br>
    <i> Relative  distribution of X = (Distribution of X) / (Distribution of all Species)</i> <br><br>
      Distribution is measured as the number of moniotoing plots that a species occurs in.  
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> Each of these three components will have a value between 0 and 1, and the IV is simply the sum of these three values.
</p>

<p>
  Every tree species found has an importance value. You can see a graph of importance values of up to 20 species by clicking on "Graph", and you can see a table with the values for all of the species by clicking on "Data".

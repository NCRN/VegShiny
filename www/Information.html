<h3> Project Information</h3>

<p>This website presents the results of long-term monitoring of forest vegetation in eleven national parks in and around Washington DC. The study is carried out by the <a href="http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/ncrn/">National Capital Region Network (NCRN) Inventory and Monitoring Program </a>The monitoring program began in 2006 with the goal of determining the status of and trends in forest condition, as indicated a variety of measures. The information on this website is based on permanent monitoring plots which are randomly located in the forested areas of the parks. Approximately one-fourth of the plots are monitored each year. After four years all of the plots have been visited, and the process is repeated. By visiting the same set of plots every four years we are able to determine how the forests are changing. For detailed methods, please consult the data collection protocol listed in the Citations & References tab above.</p>

<h3>Data Collected</h3>
<p><strong>Trees</strong><br>
Trees are defined as woody plants that have a diameter at breast height (dbh) - diameter taken at a height of 1.37m or 4.5 feet - of at least 10 cm (~4 inches). During monitroing, trees are identified to species, their dbh is measured, and they are examined for a variety of factors related to plant health.   These factors include postion in the canopy; presence of injuries to the bark, branches, or large numbers of leaves; presence of diseases or insect pests; and the presence of vines growing on the trees. The diameter of the tree is used to calculate the "basal area" of the tree, basically the area of a cross section of the trunk. This is used as a measure of the size of the tree.</p>

<p><strong>Saplings</strong><br>
Saplings are small trees with a dbh between 1 and 10 cm (0.4 - 4 inches). Like trees, saplings are identified and their diameter is measured. In addition to the plant health observations for trees, we assess saplings to see if their leaves have been browsed by deer.</p>
  
<p><strong>Shrubs</strong><br>
Shrubs are woody plant species that typically divide into multiple stems at the base of the plants where they emerge from the ground. This differentiates them from trees, which are typically a single stem at the base. Shrubs are identified to species and assessed for evidence of deer browse.</p>
  
<p><strong>Tree and Shrub Seedlings</strong><br>
Seedlings are trees or shrubs  with a dbh of less than 1cm. Data is only collected on seedlings which are at least 15 cm (~ 6 inches) tall. Smaller seedlings are not recorded as they have a very high mortality rate and monitoring them would add little to our understanding of the forest. We identify seedlings to species, measure their height, and look for evidence of deer browse. </p>
  
<p><strong>Understory Plants</strong><br>
Understory plants is a broad category which inlcudes a variety of species that are found on the forest floor. Only a subset of understory plant species are monitored, primarily species which are either exotic invasives or are known to be preferentailly consumed by deer. Most of these plants are not woody, but a few are woody shrubs that either grow as numerous small individuals (e.g. blueberries) or are found in dense thorny thickets (e.g. Japanese barberry). The protocol document listed in the Citations & References tab has a list of all species monitored as understory plants. Note that a plant can be monitored both as an understory plant and as a vine when it occurs both on trees and on the forest floor (e.g. English ivy). We idenitfy each plant to species and estimate its percent cover. This is done by examining a number of 1m<sup>2</sup> quadrats and determining the percent of the ground covered by that species.<p>  

<p><strong>Vines in Trees</strong><br>
  Every tree in a monitoring plot is inspected for the presence of vines. The species of each vine is recorded. This website provides information on how many trees are hosts to vines. The abundance of each vine species is estimated by the number of trees they grow on and we do not attempt to measure the size of the individual vines.

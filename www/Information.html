<h3> Introduction</h3>

<p>This website presents the results of long-term monitoring of forest vegetation in eleven national parks. The monitoring program begain in 2006 with the goal of determining the status of and trends in forest condition, as indicated a variety of measures. The information on this website is based on permanent monitoring plots which are randomly located in the forested areas of the parks. Approximately one-fourth of the plots are montiored each year. After four years all of the plots have been visited, and the process is repeated. By visiting the same set of plots every four years we are able to determine how the forests are changing. For detailed methods, please consult the data collection protocol listed in the Citations & References tab above.</p>

<h3>Data Collected</h3>
<p><strong>Trees</strong><br>
Trees are defined as woody plants that have a diameter at breast height (dbh= 1.37m or 4.5 feet) of at least 10 cm (~4 inches). Trees are identified to species, their diameter is measured and they are examined for a variety of factors related to plant health.   These factors include postion in the canopy, presence of injuries to the bark, branches or large numbers of leaves, presence of diseases or insect pests, and the presence of vines growing on the trees. The diameter of the tree is used to calculate the "basal area" of the tree, basically the area of a cross section of the trunk. This is used as a measure of the size of the tree.</p>

<p><strong>Saplings</strong><br>
Saplings are small trees with a dbh between 1 and 10 cm (0.4 - 4 inches). Like trees, saplings are identified and their diameter is measured. In addition to the plant health observations made for trees, saplings are also assessed to see if their leaves have been browsed by deer.</p>
  
<p><strong>Shrubs</strong><br>
Shrubs are woody plant spcies that typically divide into multiple stems at the base of the plants where they emerges from the ground. This differentiates them from trees, which are typically a single stem at the base. Shrubs are identified to species and assessed for evidence of deer browse.</p>
  
<p><strong>Tree and Shrub Seedlings</strong><br>
Seedlings are trees or shrubs  with a dbh of less than 1cm. Data is only collected on seedlings which are at least 15 cm (~ 6 inches) tall. Smaller seedlings are not recorded as they have a very high mortality rate and monitoring them would add little to our understanding of the forest. Seedlings are identified to species, their height is measured and they are examied for evidence of deer browse. </p>
  
<p><strong>Understory Plants</strong><br>
Understory plants is a broad category which inlcudes a variety of plants that are found on the forest floor. Most of these plants are not woody, and are either exotic invasives or are know to be preferentailly consumed by deer. A few are woody shrubs that either grow as numerous small individuals (e.g. blueberries) or are found in dense thorny thicketes (e.g. Japaneese barberry). The protocol document listed in the Citations & References tab has a list of all species montired in this category. Note that a plant can be monitored both as an understory plant and as a vine when it occurs both on trees and on the forest floor (e,g. English ivy). Each targeted plant is identified to species and its % cover is estimated. This is done by examining a number of 1m<sup>2</sup> quadrats and detemrineing the percent of the ground covered by that species.<p>  

<p><strong>Vines in Trees</strong><br>
  Every tree is in the monitoring plots is inspected for the presence of vines. The species of each vine is recorded. This website provides information on how many trees are hosts to vines. The abundace of each vine species is estimated by the number of trees they grown on and we do not attempt to measure the size of the individual vines.

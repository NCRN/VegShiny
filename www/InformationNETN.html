<h3> Project Information</h3>

<p>This website presents the results of long-term monitoring of forest vegetation in eight national parks in New England, New York and New Jersey. The study is carried out by the <a href="https://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/netn/monitor/programs/ForestHealth/forestHealth.cfm"> Northeast Temperate Network (NETN) Inventory and Monitoring Program </a>The monitoring program began in 2006 with the goal of determining the status of and trends in forest condition, as indicated by a variety of measures. The information on this website is based on permanent monitoring plots which are randomly located in the publically-owned forested areas of the parks. Approximately one-fourth of the plots are monitored each year. After four years all of the plots have been visited, and the process is repeated. By visiting the same set of plots every four years we are able to determine how the forests are changing. For detailed methods, please consult the data collection protocol listed in the Citations & References tab above. All information presented is based on accepted data that has undergone a rigorous QA/QC process.</p>

<h3>Data Collected</h3>
<p><strong>Trees</strong><br>
Trees are defined as woody plants that have a diameter at breast height (dbh = diameter taken at a height of 1.37m or 4.5 feet above the ground) of at least 10 cm (~4 inches). During monitoring, trees are identified to species, their dbh is measured within a 20 x 20m (15 x 15m in Acadia NP) square plots. Trees are also examined for a variety of factors related to plant health, including postion in the canopy; presence of diseases or insect pests; tree vigor; and twig dieback. The diameter of the tree is used to calculate the "basal area" of the tree, basically the area of a cross section of the trunk. This is used as a measure of the size of the tree.</p>

<p><strong>Saplings</strong><br>
Saplings are small trees with a dbh between 1 and 10 cm (0.4 - 4 inches). Like trees, saplings are identified and their diameter is measured. Saplings are measured in three circular microplots, each 2 m in radius.</p>
  
<p><strong>Shrubs</strong><br>
Shrubs are woody plant species that typically divide into multiple stems at the base of the plants where they emerge from the ground. This differentiates them from trees, which are typically a single stem at the base. Shrubs are identified to species and their cover is assessed in three circular microplots, each 2 m in radius.</p>
  
<p><strong>Tree Seedlings</strong><br>
Seedlings are trees with a dbh of less than 1 cm. Data is collected on seedlings which are at least 15 cm (~ 6 inches) tall. Smaller seedlings are not recorded as they have a very high mortality rate. We identify seedlings to species and measure their height in three circular microplots, each 2 m in radius. </p>
  
<p><strong>Understory Plants</strong><br>
Understory plants include all vascular species that are found within 1.5 meters of the forest floor. Within each of eight 1m<sup>2</sup> quadrats, we idenitfy each plant species and assign it a cover class.<p>

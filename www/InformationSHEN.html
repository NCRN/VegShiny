<h3> Project Information</h3>

<p>This website presents the results of long-term monitoring of forest vegetation in Shenandoah National Park.  The current forest vegetation monitoring protocol was initiated in 2003 and assesses the status and trends of forest plant communities, including herbaceous and exotic vegetation, downed woody debris and snags, and soils. Sites are stratified according to elevation, aspect and bedrock geology. Site locations were randomly chosen within forested areas of the park occurring beyond the influence of roads, trails, and developed areas. Each site consists of a 24 x 24 meter slope-corrected square plot</p>

<p>The current protocol was designed to sample the 160 plots within the monitoring program over a four year sampling rotation; however, the early cycles were shorter than 4 years.  Beginning in 2013, 80 plots were sampled every other year.  The sampling cycles are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cycle 1: 2003 – 2005</li>
<li>Cycle 2: 2007 (all plots sampled in a single season)</li>
<li>Cycle 3: 2008 – 2011</li>
<li>Cycle 4: 2013 – 2015</li>
<li>Cycle 5: 2017 – 2019 (80 plots sampled in 2017; planning to sample remainder in 2019)</li>
</ul>
<p>All information presented is based on accepted data that has been reviewed as part of a quality assurance process.</p>

<h3>Data Collected</h3>

<p><strong>Trees</strong><br>
Trees are defined as woody plants that have a 10 cm or greater diameter at breast height (DBH), a height of 1.37m above the ground. During monitoring, trees are identified to species, their DBH is measured, and they are examined for a variety of factors related to plant health. These factors include position in the canopy, crown health, foliage health, and the presence of diseases or insect pests. The diameter of the tree is used to calculate the cross sectional area of the trunk, referred to as the "basal area".</p>

<p><strong>Saplings</strong><br>
Saplings are small trees with a DBH less than 10 cm and a height greater than or equal to 1.5 meters.  Saplings are identified and tallied in four size classes.  Saplings are not tracked individually from one sampling cycle to the next (i.e., they are not tagged).</p>

<p><strong>Shrubs</strong><br>
Shrubs are woody plant species of relatively low stature with a DBH less than 10 cm and a height greater than or equal to 1.5 meters.  Species that are classified as shrubs may have multiple stems radiating from a central crown, in which case each stem is counted separately, or they may take the form of a small tree that is unlikely to reach the forest canopy.  Vines that meet the DBH and height criteria for shrubs are counted as such.  Shrubs are identified and tallied into four size classes, and are not tracked individually from one sampling cycle to the next.</p>

<p><strong>Tree and Shrub Seedlings</strong><br>
Woody vegetation with a DBH &lt; 10 cm and a height &lt; 1.5 m are classified as seedlings.  Seedlings less than 15 cm tall are not counted.  Vines that meet the DBH and height criteria for seedlings are counted as such. Seedlings are identified and tallied in two size classes, and are not tracked individually from one sampling cycle to the next.</p>

<p><strong>Understory Plants</strong><br>
This category includes all herbaceous species and a select group of particularly invasive exotic species, some of which are woody.  A complete species list is recorded for the entire plot, and a percent cover class is assigned to each species.  Percent cover class was assigned to only the most dominant herbs prior to 2013, so comparisons of pre- and post-2013 herb cover are not recommended.</p>
